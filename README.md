### Hi, I'm Henry ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer in the [Brain Development and Disorders Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/richardslab/).

- ðŸ”­ &nbsp; I'm interested in building tools to encourage open science and improve the sharing and management of scientific data.
- ðŸŒ± &nbsp; My background is in Software Engineering, but I enjoy the challenge of working in a research environment and the opportunities to explore new ideas with creative problem-solving!
- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp; Ask me about building complex full-stack web applications, online cognitive tasks, and working as a Research Software Engineer!
- ðŸ“« &nbsp; How to reach me: I have a [website](https://henryburgess.net), infrequently updated with some of my travel adventures and thoughts.
