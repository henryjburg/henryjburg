### Hi, I'm Henry 👋

I'm a Software Engineer in the [Brain Development and Disorders lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/richardslab/) 🧠!

- 🔭 &nbsp; I’m currently working on ways to improve the technical possibilities of neurocognitive tasks using modern development tools while keeping accessibility first.
- 🌱 &nbsp; My background was in Software Engineering, I'm learning computational neuroscience in my spare time, and I hope to do a PhD in the field.
- 🤝 &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate to improve existing online tools or create new tools that will further the capabilities of online behavioural and cognitive tasks while promoting accessibility.
- 💬 &nbsp; Ask me about running neurocognitive tasks online and jsPsych!
