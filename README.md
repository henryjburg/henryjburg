### Hi, I'm Henry 👋

I'm a Software Engineer in the [Brain Development and Disorders Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/richardslab/).

- 🔭 &nbsp; I’m currently working on ways to improve the technical possibilities of online research using modern development tools while keeping accessibility first. Outside of this, I spend my time building tools that support the neuroscientific research of the lab generally.
- 🌱 &nbsp; My background is in Software Engineering, but I enjoy the challenges of working in a research environment and the opportunities to explore new ideas with creative problem-solving!
- 🤝 &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate to improve existing tools or create new tools that will further the capabilities of online research tasks and promote web accessibility.
- 💬 &nbsp; Ask me about building complex full-stack web applications, online research tasks, and working in research as a Software Engineer!
- 📫 &nbsp; How to reach me: I have a [website](https://henryburgess.me), infrequently updated with some of my adventures.
